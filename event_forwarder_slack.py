# Example of how to build a custom integration for event forwarding, in this
# example reading events using the REST API and forwarding them to Slack using
# a Slack Incoming Webhook.
#
# USAGE
# 1. Save the latest version of both this file (event_forwarder_slack.py) and
#    the DI API Wrapper (deepinstinct3.py) to the same folder on disk.
# 2. Review and adjust configuration in-line below, then save changes.
# 3. By default the script will pull all events matching your configured search
#    parameters. To start at a specific event ID, save that ID as a file
#    'event_forwarder_slack.conf' in the same directory as the script.
# 3. Execute the script with this command: python event_forwarder_slack.py

# NOTE: In order to avoid re-sending the same events, the script maintains a
#       record of the last event previously sent on disk. This is stored in
#       'event_forwarder_slack.conf' in the same directory as the script. This
#       allows preservation of this "high water mark" even if the script is
#       killed and restarted. Be cautious not to delete/rename/move the .conf
#       file. Doing so will cause the script to re-send all events.
