# This script provides an example of how to use the Deep Instinct REST API
# Wrapper published at https://github.com/pvz01/deepinstinct_rest_api_wrapper
# to provision new MSPs on a multi-tenancy server, including pre-populating
# them with a set of policies based upon a template MSP.

# This script is provided as-is and with no warranty. Use at your own risk, and
# please test in a non-production environment first.

# PREREQUISITES
# 1. Python 3.8 or later
# 2. Deep Instinct REST API Wrapper
# 3. Third-party libraries (strongly recommend to install Anaconda)
# 4. Network access to management server on port 443
# 5. Multi-tenancy enabled D-Appliance (management server)
# 6. A Full Access API key for all MSPs

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND USAGE NOTES
# Only policy settings that are available to read and write via the
# DI REST API are migrated. Any settings not visible via the API remain
# at their defailts in the destination policies. As of December 2021, the
# non-visible fields in Windows policies are:
# 1. Enable D-Cloud services
# 2. Embedded DDE object in Microsoft Office document
# 3. Suspicious Script Execution
# 4. Malicious PowerShell Command Execution
# 5. Suspicious Activity Detection
# 6. Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution
# 7. Integrate D-Client with Windows Security Center
# 8. Permitted connections for network isolated devices
# 9. Gradual Deployment
# For up-to-date information, reference the WindowsPolicyData model in the API
# documentation on your DI server. If/when additional fields are added, this
# script will automatically migrate them.

# USAGE
# 1. Save the latest version of both this file (provision_msp.py) and
#    the DI API Wrapper (deepinstinct30.py) to the same folder on disk.
# 2. Edit this file to provide the customer name, license count, server, api
#    key, and the id of the template msp in-line below.
# 3. Execute the script with this command:  python provision_msp.py
