# This example script should be run on a recurring basis (suggest 1X daily)
# using a scheduling tool of your choice. It queries the server for devices,
# then iterates through them and finds ones that match your defined criteria
# for identifying offline non-persistent VDI devices which are consuming a
# license. When matches are found, it then requests an uninstall of those
# devices. This results in the Deployment Status on those devices moving to
# Pending Uninstall, which immediately releases the license(s) consumed and
# hides the devices from the Dashboard and any views or queries that display
# only devices with an activated license.

# OPTIONAL - uncomment the line of code above to archive (hide from GUI and API)
# the devices in addition to requesting an uninstall. This can be advantegous
# if you want to completely hide the devices from all views in the GUI (even
# those with zero filters), but it has a negative effect of also hiding any
# associated events. Additionally, if a device is erroneously archived it does
# not get automatically un-archived if it reconnects as of 3.3.
