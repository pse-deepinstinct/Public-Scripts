# Example of how to build your own e-mail forwarder, meaning you can define
# exactly what events you want to send and to who and with what template.
# This sample uses https://pypi.org/project/yagmail/ to send e-mail using a
# GMail account, but you can replace the  send_event_via_email method with your
# own code to use any library and e-mail service of your choice.
#
# USAGE
# 1. Save the latest version of both this file (event_forwarder_email.py) and
#    the DI API Wrapper (deepinstinct3.py) to the same folder on disk.
# 2. Review and adjust configuration in-line below, then save changes.
# 3. By default the script will pull all events matching your configured search
#    parameters. To start at a specific event ID, save that ID as a file
#    'event_forwarder_email.conf' in the same directory as the script.
# 4. Optionally replace or modify the send_event_via_email() method to use
#    any mail template, library, or service of your choosing.
# 5. Execute the script with this command: python event_forwarder_email.py
#
# NOTE: In order to avoid re-sending the same events, the script maintains a
#       record of the last event previously sent on disk. This is stored in
#       'event_forwarder_email.conf' in the same directory as the script. This
#       allows preservation of this "high water mark" even if the script is
#       killed and restarted. Be cautious not to delete/rename/move the .conf
#       file. Doing so will cause the script to re-send all events.
